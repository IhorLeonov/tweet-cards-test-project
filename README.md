Hello! This project was made by me for educational purposes.
This application has two pages, the main actions take place on the Tweets page, where user information comes from the backend.
Implemented such functions as routing, pagination, working with state, storing and changing data.
The user has the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe to other users, as well as filter data.
